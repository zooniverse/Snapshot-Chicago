    content: '''
      Snapshot Chicago is a collaboration between two of Chicagoâ€™s esteemed institutions, born of the desire to get everyone
      involved in the scientific process. The project aims to achieve a greater understanding of how our urban development affects
      local biodiversity. Anyone can participate and help us learn about this great city we live in!

      <p>With your help, we've classified all the data we have so far. Great work!</p>
      <p>
        We're leaving some images up for further classification, but we have more projects
        (like <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/project/cyclonecenter">Cyclone Center</a>
        and <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/project/batdetective">Bat Detective</a>) that need your help.
        Visit <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">zooniverse.org</a> to see them all.

      <p>
        Keep an eye on <a href="http://blog.snapshotserengeti.org/">the blog</a>
        to learn what happens with the data the project has generated
        and to find out when more images from the Serengeti are available.

        This short tutorial will walk you through your first classification. Let's get started!
      '''

      trapsHeader: 'Check out the Images'
      traps: '''
        All over the Serengeti, scientists have set up motion sensitive camera traps.
        The camera snaps a few shots anytime something moves in front of it.

        The photos often come as a sequence of 2 or 3, called a "capture".

        Check out other snapshots in the sequence using the buttons below the image,
        or play them like a flipbook by clicking the play button.
      '''

      taskHeader: 'Identify the Animals'
      task: '''
        Your task is to identify all the different animals that appear in the photos.
        The species that will appear are listed here.

        It's a big list, and some species may be unfamiliar,
        but there are a few ways to narrow that list down using the characteristics you see.
      '''

      chooseAntelopeHeader: 'Looks like...'
      chooseAntelope: '''
        The animal in the foreground of this photo looks like a large antelope of some kind.

        Let's choose "Antelope/deer" from the "looks like" menu.
      '''

      chooseSolidHeader: 'Characteristic: Pattern'
      chooseSolid: '''
        Let's narrow the list down a bit by choosing the solid swatch from the "Pattern" menu.
      '''

      chooseCurlyHeader: 'Characteristic: Horns'
      chooseCurly: '''
        We've narrowed the list down enough to see thumbnail previews of the remaining animals.

        Choose the "Curly" icon from the "Horns" menu to narrow the list down further.
      '''

      chooseWildebeestHeader: 'Make a choice'
      chooseWildebeest: '''
        Great, that leaves us with just one option!
        Let's choose "Wildebeest" it and make sure it's a match.
      '''

      confirmWildebeestHeader: 'Looks Good!'
      confirmWildebeest: '''
        By comparing the animal to to the photos here and reading the description below, we can confirm that this is indeed a wildebeest.
        You can flip through the photos to see examples of the animal from multiple angles using the bullets on the right.
      '''

      identifyWildebeestHeader: 'Count & Behavior'
      identifyWildebeest: '''
        Once you're confident that this is a wildebeest,
        choose "1" from the count menu and "Moving" from the behavior menu.
        Then click "Identify."
      '''

      findZebrasHeader: 'Identify another animal'
      findZebras: '''
        We want to try to identify all the animals in each capture.
        Look closely and you'll notice that there are some zebras in the distance.

        Let's look at another way of classifying when we already know which species we can see.
      '''

      typeZebraHeader: 'Search'
      typeZebra: '''
        The seach field is a quick way to highlight animals whose descriptions contain certain words.

        Type "zebra" in the search field...
      '''

      clickZebraHeader: 'Search'
      clickZebra: '''
        ...and click "Zebra," which is the only animal highlighted.
      '''

      confirmZebraHeader: 'Just do your best!'
      confirmZebra: '''
        It's hard to make out the zebras in the distance, so classify as best you can.
        Each classification is compared with the classifications of other volunteers, so even if you're not sure, just try your best!
      '''

      identifyZebraHeader: 'Count & Behavior'
      identifyZebra: '''
        There are two zebras in the distance, and they appear to be grazing with their heads bowed.
        Mark "2," "Standing," and "Eating," then click "Identify."
      '''

      finishHeader: 'Nice Job!'
      finish: '''
        Now you're ready to classify some images on your own.

        In each image, do your best to identify all the animals you can,
        even if you can't see enough to be completely sure.
        If there aren't any animals in an image, check "Nothing here" and then "Finish."

        Your observations will be combined with those of multiple volunteers,
        so even if you're not sure on something, your contribution is still very useful!

        Don't forget: after classifying an image you can always discuss it with professional and citizen scientists or share it with friends.

        Click "Finish" now to move on.

        <p>
          Cities can be hostile places for wildlife, with threats coming from habitat destruction, roads and traffic, humans, pets and large numbers of invasive species.
          However, with proper management, urban areas can house a number of important wildlife species, including carnivores and small mammals.
        </p>
        <p>
          To assess the biodiversity of the greater Chicagoland area, Lincoln Park Zooâ€™s Urban Wildlife Institute has established monitoring stations within city parks,
          forest preserves, golf courses and cemeteries across a four-county area, including downtown Chicago and its suburbs. Motion-triggered cameras are deployed four
          times per year at more than 100 sites to determine which species are present and to assess spatial and long-term patterns in wildlife communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing where Chicagoâ€™s urban wildlife is located will help us to better conserve it. This knowledge will pave the way for future studies on the behavior and
          ecology of specific urban species, helping stakeholders to better manage wildlife conflict.
        </p>
      """

      questions: """
        <h1>Our Scientific Questions</h1>

        <h2>Where do they go?</h2>
        <p>We donâ€™t know as much as weâ€™d like about species in urban systems.  Even basic facts like what types of habitat attract which species are often unknown in areas like cities.
        Finding out where certain species are most likely to occur allows us to target conservation and management efforts to ensure we can coexist with our wildlife neighbors.</p>

        <h2>How are they doing?</h2>
        <p>While we canâ€™t directly measure populations with the data from our cameras, we can get a sense of which species are most common, and which may be in decline.
        This can help us make recommendations about how to improve conditions for the species that are in trouble.</p>

        <h2>How do they compete?</h2>
        <p>We know almost nothing about how species in urban areas might compete with one another, engage in predator-prey dynamics, or avoid each other.
        Preliminary results indicate that the normal community interactions we observe in natural systems donâ€™t apply to urban areas, where entirely new dynamics seem to be in place.
        By evaluating our camera images, we can begin to assemble the first complete picture of an urban ecosystem, including how all the species interact.</p>

        <h2>How do they interact with us?</h2>
        <p>By also collecting data on humans, and on pets like cats and dogs, we can get a sense of how animals in urban settings react to the people who make the city their home.
        Some animals may be attracted to sites that are often visited by humans, while others may be looking for more secluded places.   Humans are a critical part of the system,
        and our camera data allows us to understand our impact, as well as the importance of food and habitat.</p>
